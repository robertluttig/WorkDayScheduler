# WorkDayScheduler
This app assists in planning a daily schedule
the js link is at the bottom of the html so the rest of the html can load first, this prevent's any unexpected errors.
I used moment.js to update reflect the correct day on top of the app and to check for the current time to color reflect each hour in the time-block.
Local storage is not working yet.

The finished project will display the current day for the user. The day planer is set up to color each normal working day hour with a color depending on it being past, present or future. The block inbetween the time and save buttong lets the user enter text that re-appears after the page is reloaded.
